# About the new HashForm


This is reimplementation of IGLib's HashForm, a user friendly application for computation of various checksums or cryptographic hash functions of files an text. The original software is available here:
* *https://www.softpedia.com/get/Others/Miscellaneous/HashForm.shtml*
* *http://www2.arnes.si/~ljc3m2/igor/software/IGLibShellApp/HashForm.html*

Currently implemented features include:
* Main window

Other functionality of the original app is planned in the future. The intention is to provide a cross-platform application. Linux application will depend on the availability of the .NET MAUI implementation on that platform (the original application referenced above should run on Linux with Mono framework installed).
